## IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

### Step 1: Access Cloudflare DNS
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click **workdoc360.com** domain
3. Click **DNS** ‚Üí **Records**

### Step 2: Remove Incorrect @ Record
You have TWO A records for @ (root domain):
```
‚úÖ 34.117.33.233 - KEEP THIS (proxied)
‚ùå 34.111.179.208 - DELETE THIS (not proxied)
```

**Action Required:**

```
www.workdoc360.com ‚Üí 34.111.179.208 ‚ùå
```

To fix this, find the www A record and update it to:
```
Type: A
Name: www

TTL: Auto
Proxy: Enabled
```

### Step 4: Verify Results
