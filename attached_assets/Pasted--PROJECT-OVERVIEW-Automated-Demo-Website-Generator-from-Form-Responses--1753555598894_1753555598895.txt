PROJECT OVERVIEW: Automated Demo Website Generator from Form Responses
======================================================================

OBJECTIVE:
----------
Allow potential clients to complete a branded website questionnaire and have the system automatically:
1. Collect and process their responses
2. Generate a private demo website based on their answers
3. Share the preview via a private URL (e.g., https://youragency.co.uk/demo/abc123)
4. Let the client approve and transition to a Phase 1 build

FORM IMPLEMENTATION:
---------------------
- Technology: Pure HTML/CSS/JS form
- Layout: Fully responsive and styled for clarity and modern UX
- Key Sections:
  â€¢ Project Details
  â€¢ Business Information
  â€¢ Contact Information
  â€¢ Online Presence
  â€¢ Website Requirements
  â€¢ Design Preferences
  â€¢ Content & Assets
  â€¢ Additional Information
- On submission:
  â€¢ Collects form data
  â€¢ Creates a unique ID
  â€¢ Sends data to backend API at: https://yourdomain.co.uk/api/save-form
  â€¢ Displays user-friendly confirmation

HOSTING STRATEGY:
-----------------
- Avoid Replit branding entirely
- Options include:
  â€¢ Vercel + Custom Domain
  â€¢ Netlify + Cloudflare DNS
  â€¢ Cloudflare Pages (if static)
- Domain integration: Point www.youragency.co.uk to the deployed site

BACKEND OPTIONS:
----------------
[Preferred] Firebase + Cloud Function:
  - Receives JSON payload
  - Saves to Firestore
  - Generates a static site using prebuilt templates
  - Saves site under /demo/{uniqueId}

[Alternative] Node.js + Express API on Render/Replit:
  - Same logic, more control if using own infrastructure

[No-code] Make.com + Webhook:
  - Saves submission to Google Sheet
  - Triggers site generation (e.g., using Placid, Pory.io, or custom HTML render via Webhook)

TEMPLATE STRATEGY:
------------------
- Base HTML/JS templates for common layouts
- Inject form data into template variables (e.g., {businessName}, {services}, {colours})
- Save output to static hosting path: /demo/{uniqueId}/index.html

EMAIL CONFIRMATION (OPTIONAL):
-------------------------------
- Send preview link via Email using:
  â€¢ EmailJS (Client-side only)
  â€¢ SendGrid (via backend)
  â€¢ MailerLite or Make webhook

FUTURE PHASES:
--------------
- Add client login to view/edit demos
- Enable form auto-save with localStorage
- Integrate Stripe/GoCardless for phase payment collection
- CRM link (e.g., Pipedrive, HubSpot) via webhook or API
