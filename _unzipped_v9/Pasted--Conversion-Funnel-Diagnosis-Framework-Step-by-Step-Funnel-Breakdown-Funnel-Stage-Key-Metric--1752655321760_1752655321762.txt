🔍 Conversion Funnel Diagnosis Framework

🪜 Step-by-Step Funnel Breakdown

Funnel Stage	Key Metric	Possible Drop-Off Causes

1. Landing Page View → Click to Start Demo	CTR on hero button	Weak pain point messaging, unclear value
2. Start Demo → Account Signup	Sign-up rate	High friction (email/pass/confirm), unclear next step
3. Account Created → First Document Generated	Time-to-first-success	Overwhelming interface, unclear instructions, no guided flow
4. First Document → Subscription Plan View	Plan conversion rate	Pricing fear, lack of trust, “try before buy” absent
5. Plan View → Purchase	Purchase conversion rate	Card required too early, not enough urgency or ROI clarity

🧠 Gut Check Based on Your Description

You’ve probably got the most drop-off in Steps 2–4:

People love the idea, click through… but then stall once they hit:

Account sign-up friction

A big, blank dashboard with no hand-holding

Pricing wall before perceived value is delivered

✅ Targeted Conversion Fixes

1. Shorten Time to Magic

🎯 Goal: First “wow” moment within 90 seconds

Actions:

Autogenerate a demo doc preview on landing page

“No sign-up preview” option — watermark it to prevent abuse

Use pre-filled company & trade details on demo

Add this headline:

> “Don’t take our word for it — here’s a scaffold RAMS document created in 27 seconds by our AI.”





---

2. Progressive Sign-Up

Don’t ask for 5 fields and a password upfront.

Instead:

Ask only for company name + trade type to start demo

After preview:

> “Want to save, share, or generate more? Create your account to continue…”




This reduces mental friction and gives instant gratification before commitment.

3. Visual Value Proof

Your AI is doing brilliant work — show the receipts.

Add to demo:

⏱ “This document normally takes 3.5 hours… you did it in 28 seconds.”

💸 “Estimated labour cost saved: £212”

✅ “Meets HSE/CDM 2015 compliance requirements”



---

4. Pricing Optimization

New Structure (to test):

Tier	Price	Features

Starter	£35/mo	1 user, 10 docs/mo, 1 company
Pro	£65/mo	3 users, unlimited docs, multi-company
Growth+	£99/mo	Priority support, mobile access, e-signing


Offer 3-month minimum or money-back guarantee

OR: First doc free, then pay to unlock downloads or editing



---

5. Where to Focus First (if you’re tight on time)

1. ✅ Refactor demo onboarding flow – get to doc preview in 2 steps max


2. ✅ Rework landing copy with direct pain leads and time/cost savings


3. ✅ Run Hotjar or session recordings — watch where users rage-click or stall


4. ✅ A/B test starter pricing tier or doc-per-month freemium plan
