2. Position material storage areas with vehicle access
3. Install temporary power supply for tools and lighting
4. Set up mortar mixing station with water supply

**Day 3-5: Foundation Work**
1. Check foundation levels using optical level (±5mm tolerance)
2. Install damp-proof course (DPC) minimum 150mm above ground level
3. Lay first course of blocks to establish building line
4. Check corners for square using 3-4-5 triangle method

### Phase 2: Wall Construction (Weeks 2-6)
**Week 2-3: Ground Floor Walls**
1. **External Cavity Wall Construction:**
   - Lay inner leaf blockwork to DPC level
   - Install cavity ties every 900mm horizontally, 450mm vertically
   - Place insulation boards tight against inner leaf
   - Build outer leaf brickwork maintaining 50mm cavity

2. **Quality Control Points:**
   - Check plumb every 4 courses using spirit level
   - Maintain consistent mortar joint thickness (10mm ±2mm)
   - Ensure weather-struck pointing for water shedding
   - Verify cavity width using gauge rod

**Week 4-5: Upper Level Construction**
1. **Lintel Installation:**
   - Steel lintels positioned on 150mm minimum bearings
