- "Building Regulations compliance" (not "code compliance")
- "Safety glazing" (not "tempered glass")
- "WER rating" (Window Energy Rating)
- "Competent Person Scheme"
- "Self-certification"

This documentation framework ensures comprehensive compliance coverage for window fitters while maintaining UK industry standards and terminology.
