3. Click "DNS" or "Manage DNS"

### Add This Single Record:

Name: @ 
Value: 34.117.33.233
TTL: 1 Hour
```

## Result After Adding This Record:
- ‚úÖ https://workdoc360.com will work (currently broken)
- ‚úÖ https://www.workdoc360.com will continue working
- ‚úÖ Both will load your WorkDoc360 application

## Optional: Add Customer Portal Subdomains

```
