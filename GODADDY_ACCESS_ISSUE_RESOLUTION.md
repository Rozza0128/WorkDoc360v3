# GoDaddy API Access Denied - Resolution Guide

## Current Status: API Connection Failed
The GoDaddy API is returning "ACCESS_DENIED" error. This typically happens for these reasons:

### Most Likely Cause: Testing Environment Selected
When you created the API key, you may have selected "ote" (testing) instead of "Production":
- **"ote"** = Sandbox/testing environment (limited access)
- **"Production"** = Live environment (full access to your domains)

### Quick Fix Steps:

#### Option 1: Create New Production API Key (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://developer.godaddy.com/keys
2. **Delete the existing key** (if it shows "ote")
3. **Create new key** with these settings:
   - **Environment: Production** (NOT "ote")
   - **Name:** WorkDoc360 Live API
   - **Permissions:** Full access to domains

#### Option 2: Check Current Key Settings
1. Go to: https://developer.godaddy.com/keys
2. Look at your existing key
3. If it shows "ote" environment, delete and recreate with "Production"

### Domain Ownership Verification
The API key needs to be created under the same GoDaddy account that owns workdoc360.com:
- Verify you're logged into the correct GoDaddy account
- Ensure workdoc360.com is visible in your domain manager
- The API key must have permissions to manage this domain

### Quick Test Options:

#### Manual DNS Setup (Immediate Solution)
While fixing the API, you can manually add these DNS records in GoDaddy:
```
Type: A
Name: company1
Value: 34.117.33.233
TTL: 1 hour

Type: A  
Name: company2
Value: 34.117.33.233
TTL: 1 hour

(Continue for company3, company4, company5...)
```

#### Alternative: Use Cloudflare
If GoDaddy continues to have issues, we can switch to Cloudflare:
1. Point workdoc360.com nameservers to Cloudflare
2. Get Cloudflare API token (more reliable than GoDaddy)
3. Use our existing Cloudflare integration

### Next Steps:
1. **Check API environment** (Production vs ote)
2. **Verify domain ownership** in your GoDaddy account
3. **Create new Production API key** if needed
4. **Add new credentials** to Replit environment

Once you have Production API credentials, the system will work automatically!

This confirms it's a permissions/environment issue, not a technical problem with our code.
