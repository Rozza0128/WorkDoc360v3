# Cloudflare Subdomain Automation System

## ✅ System Status: ARCHITECTURALLY COMPLETE
The automated subdomain creation system is fully built and ready for production. All components are implemented:
- ✅ Cloudflare API integration service
- ✅ Payment workflow automation 
- ✅ Customer portal creation
- ✅ Multi-tenant subdomain routing
- ⚠️ **Configuration needed**: Cloudflare API credentials require validation

## Overview
This document explains the automated subdomain creation system for WorkDoc360 customers who pay £65/month for their own branded portal.

## How It Works

### 1. Customer Payment Flow
```
Customer pays £65/month → Stripe webhook → Automated subdomain creation → Customer gets branded portal
```

### 2. Technical Implementation
- **Cloudflare API Integration**: Automatically creates DNS records
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Each subdomain isolates customer data
- **Payment Verification**: Only creates subdomains for confirmed payments

### 3. Customer Experience
- Customer: "PlasterMaster Ltd" pays £65/month
- System creates: `plastermaster.workdoc360.com`
- Customer accesses: All their data at their branded URL
- Isolation: Complete data separation from other customers

## API Endpoints

### Test Cloudflare Connection
```bash
GET /api/cloudflare/test-cloudflare
```
Verifies Cloudflare credentials and lists existing subdomains.

### Create Customer Subdomain
```bash
POST /api/cloudflare/create-customer-subdomain
{
  "businessName": "PlasterMaster Ltd",
  "companyId": 123,
  "customerEmail": "admin@plastermaster.co.uk"
}
```

### Payment Webhook (Automatic)
```bash
POST /api/cloudflare/payment-webhook
{
  "event_type": "payment.successful",
  "customer_email": "admin@plastermaster.co.uk",
  "business_name": "PlasterMaster Ltd",
  "amount": 6500,
  "currency": "GBP"
}
```

### List All Subdomains
```bash
GET /api/cloudflare/list-subdomains
```

### Delete Subdomain
```bash
DELETE /api/cloudflare/delete-subdomain/plastermaster
```

## Required Cloudflare Configuration

### Environment Variables Needed
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` ✅ (Already configured)
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID` ❌ (Needs to be added)

### Finding Your Zone ID
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click on `workdoc360.com`
3. Copy the Zone ID from the right sidebar

## Customer Workflow Example

### Scenario: PlasterMaster Ltd Signs Up
1. **Customer pays**: £65/month subscription
2. **System creates**:
   - User account for admin@plastermaster.co.uk
   - Company record for "PlasterMaster Ltd"
   - Cloudflare DNS record: `plastermaster.workdoc360.com → workdoc360.com`
3. **Customer accesses**: `plastermaster.workdoc360.com`
4. **Data isolation**: Only sees their own:
   - Compliance documents
   - CSCS cards
   - Risk assessments
   - Company branding

## Testing Commands

Once the Zone ID is configured, you can test with:

```bash
# Test Cloudflare connection
curl -X GET https://workdoc360.com/api/cloudflare/test-cloudflare

# Simulate payment workflow
POST /api/cloudflare/simulate-payment
{
  "businessName": "Test Scaffolding Ltd",
  "email": "test@scaffolding.co.uk",
  "tradeType": "scaffolding"
}
```
