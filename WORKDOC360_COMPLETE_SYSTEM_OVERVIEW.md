## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture Details

### Subdomain Detection System
**File**: `server/middleware/subdomainDetection.ts`
**Process**:
```javascript
Request: plastermaster.workdoc360.com
↓
Extract subdomain: "plastermaster"
↓
Database lookup: companies.company_slug = "plastermaster"
↓
Set request context: req.company = PlasterMaster Ltd
↓
Route to company-specific data and branding
```

### Data Isolation
- Each company has isolated data via `companyId` foreign keys
- Company branding stored in `company_branding` table
- Document storage segregated by company
- User access controlled via `company_users` role-based permissions

---

## 🛡️ Security & Authentication

### Authentication System
**Implementation**: Native email/password with bcrypt hashing
**Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions via connect-pg-simple
**API Security**: Token-based authentication for mobile integration
**Multi-factor**: TOTP and backup codes via speakeasy library

### Data Protection
- All company data isolated by tenant
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, User)
- Encrypted password storage
- Secure session management
- API rate limiting and validation

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables Structure
```sql
users                 # Authentication and user profiles
├── companies         # Multi-tenant company records
│   ├── company_users     # Role-based company access
│   ├── cscs_cards        # UK construction certifications
│   ├── risk_assessments  # Safety documentation
