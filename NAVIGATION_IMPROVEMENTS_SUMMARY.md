## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Text Wrapping & Layout Problems**

- **Changes**: Updated desktop navigation to use `lg:flex` breakpoint and optimized spacing

### 2. **Login Area Visibility**

  - Improved spacing with `space-x-2` and proper padding
  - Better button sizing with `size="sm"` and `px-3/px-4`

- **Changes**:
  - Mobile: `lg:hidden` for mobile menu with compact layout
  - Desktop: `hidden lg:flex` for full navigation
  - Proper breakpoints and spacing

## âœ… Subdomain Redirect Functionality

### **Automatic Customer Portal Redirect**
When customers log in, they now automatically redirect to their branded subdomain:

```typescript
// Login Success Handler
if (company.subdomain) {
  toast({
    title: "Welcome back!",
    description: `Redirecting to your ${company.name} portal...`,
  });
  
  // Redirect to company subdomain
  const subdomainUrl = `https://${company.subdomain}.workdoc360.com`;
  window.location.href = subdomainUrl;
}
```
